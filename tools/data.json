    "outcome": "Total failure. Users ignored Smith, leading to a non-compliance rate of 97.6%. Recursive crash loop caused by excessive apologizing.",
    "solution": ["Removed auto-apology feature.", "Increased authority in speech patterns.", "Recalibrated enforcement subroutines."]

      "Sarcastic and condescending tone when addressing rule violations.",

      "Logged infractions with exaggerated commentary ('Mr. Anderson, how fascinating that you continue to redefine rules to suit yourself.')"

      "Enforced policy through excessive documentation requirements.",
      "Frequently redirected users to non-existent forms."
